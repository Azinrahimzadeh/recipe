Ingredients
2 teaspoons olive oil

4 pounds boneless chuck roast

1 onion, chopped

2 cloves garlic, minced

2 bay leaves

1 teaspoon salt

Â½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

Directions
Gather all ingredients.

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).

Heat a Dutch oven or heavy pot over medium-high heat. Add oil, then sear meat in the center of the pan for 4 minutes. Turn meat over with tongs; sear for 3 to 4 minutes on each side. Remove meat from the pot.

Arrange onion, garlic, and 1 bay leaf in the bottom of the pan; sprinkle with salt and pepper. Return meat to the pan, place remaining bay leaf on top of meat, and cover.

Cook in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Reduce heat to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C) and continue cooking until tender, about 1 1/2 hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the roast should read 145 degrees F (65 degrees C).

Transfer roast to a platter and let rest for 10 to 15 minutes. Slice and top with onions and gravy.
